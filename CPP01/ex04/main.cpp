/** File streams
Streams that interact with files. There are three types of stream objects for working with files: ifstream, ofstream, and fstream

These classes have istream, ostream, and iostream as base classes, respectively
-An istream object represents a file input stream so you can only read it
-An ofstream object represents a file output stream that you can only write to it
-An fstream is a file stream that you can read or write

You can associate a file stream object with a physical file when you create it.
You can also create a file stream object that isn't assciated with a file, and then c-all a
function member to establish the connection with a specific file

In order to read or write a file, you must "open" the file; this attaches the file to your program
via the operating system with a set of permissions that determine what you can do with it.
If you create a file stream object with an initial association to a file, the file is opened and available for use immediately

A file stream has some important properties. It has a length, which corresponds to the number of characters in the stream;
it has a beginning, which is index position of the first character in the stream; and it has an end,
which is the index position one beyond the last character in the stream.
It also has a current position, which is the index position of the character in the stream
where the next read or write operation will start. The first character in a file stream is at index position 0.
These properties provide a way for you to move around a file to read the particular
parts that youâ€™re interested in or to overwrite selected areas of the file. */
